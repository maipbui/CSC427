Part d:
Suppose there are n inputs: x1, x2, ..., xn
1/ If bk = -1, then the MP neuron produces OR logic.
2/ If bk = -n, then the MP neuron produces AND logic.
3/ If bk > -1, then the MP neuron will always be in the firing state.
4/ If bk < -n, then the MP neuron will always be in the quiescent state.
